# Who am I?
Based in turin, my name's **Giulio** and i'm a 16 y/o web-developer with the love of sport, in particular track&field and its promotion. Two years ago I created a web journal about athletics and its WebTV. The need to have an information system for live streaming appeared immediately, so with my knowledge of node.js I developed "TFstream" and all its derivatives (TFcross, TFracewalk) to allow integration and visualization of the results of sporting events in real time.

TFstream is the leading web-based application for integrating the athletic timing results of most timing systems (ALGE Timing - LYNX - LIF files - EVT files) into easy-to-use graphics. Use OBS-websocket to display various graphics. It currently supports track competitions (timed results) and throwing and jumping competitions (extension measurements). Does not yet support vertical jumps (high jump and pole vault).

TFcross is the alternative to TFstream but for road and cross races. Generate startlists and timing results from data from the Italian timing system "iRunning". It does not yet automatically integrate with OBS-websocket

TFracewalk is the web application dedicated to the communication of warning data (suspension and release) in walking races. It does not include the integration of chronometric data and is currently deprecated as it does not currently have a central role compared to other apps.
